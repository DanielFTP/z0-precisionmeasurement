# Installing with conda

1. Install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) (miniconda probably works too?).
2. `conda env create` reads the `environment.yml` file in this
   repository, creates a new env and installs all necessary packages
   into it.
3. Activate the new env: `conda activate z0-env`
4. Start `jupyter-lab` (or `jupyter-notebook` if you prefer) in the
   environment. This will usually open your browesr automatically. If
   not the link is printed to the console too.
